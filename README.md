After reading BA Geography and Chinese at the University of Nottingham I found myself in hospitality - discovering myself to be a natural leader and an excellent communicator with unmatched barista skills. I've always been interested in tech but had always thought after my degree choice this career had been placed out of my reach. After stumbling across a blog about coding bootcamps I realised this was not the case and enrolled in Makers Academy straight away! Makers Academy is Europe's leading Web Developer bootcamp - they teach students how to work and how to learn.

I am looking for a developer role that will provide opportunities for growth and a chance to work with new technologies in an exciting environment.

#### Problem solving

In my previous role I tackled problems with enthusiasm to ensure customer experiences were not impacted, sometimes requiring me to be inventive or assertive as a team leader. I always found great reward these moments.

I was able to go much further with this attitude during my time at Makers Academy. The errors and exceptions I encountered while learning to code did not deter me - they lead me to research and discover, more intimately, the details of how things work. This curiousity helped me learn _what_ to look for, and _where_ to look for it, when things don't go as planned.


#### Mentoring

I've been involved with mentoring since I was 17 and I strong believe it is an important and powerful tool for learning and development on both sides. At Makers Academy I was lucky enough to have two mentees - a relationship I intend to maintain well beyond the 12 weeks of the course. Making myself available and approachable gave me the opportunity to pass on advice from my recent experiences and to share my knowledge about particular problems they encountered - something I get a lot of value and satisfaction out of.

Being so passionate about mentoring, I have started a group with my mentees - which they have now added their own mentees to. My ambition is to have this group continue to grow into an extremely valuable network of support, advice and information for bootcamp students and graduates.

#### Working as a part of a team

Since University I have found myself working in both big and small teams in a variety of environments. In my previous career I found myself leading shifts and often entire days of business independently. During my time at Makers academy I have worked on many different projects with different teams - always finding that the success of the project was a direct result of great teamwork.

#### Makers Academy (July 2016 to September 2016)

A 16-week web development bootcamp which puts emphasis on:
- Pair programming
- Test driven development and behaviour driven development
- Agile methodologies
- Object-oriented design
- How to learn and apply knowledge in a pressured environment and a short space of time

During my time at Makers I passionately solved problems, learnt best practices such as Test Driven Development and Pair Programming whilst discovering the satisfaction and joy that can come from coding - and I'm hooked. This course also armed me with a confidence in my ability that has allowed me to step into the unknown and take on completely new technologies with alacrity.
